  ## project overview
  
  IN THIS project WE WILL CLASSIFY WHETHER THE STOCKS OF THE COMPANY WILL GO UP OR GO DOWN

ON THE BASIS OF THE TOP 25 HEADLINES ABOUT THE COMPANY.

WE WILL BE DOING TEXT PREPROCESSING AND THEN WE WILL USE RANDOM-FOREST CLASSIFIER AND NAIVE BAYES CLASSIFIER FOR THE PURPOSE OF CLASSIFICATION.

WE WILL USE BOTH 'BAG OF WORDS MODEL' AND 'TF-IDF VECTORIZER' TO CONVERT TEXT INTO VECTORS.
